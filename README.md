<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


You awake in a glade with no memory... (classic)
Ahead is a magical creature, mortally wounded. It tells you to hurry and save the princess. With it's dying breath it hands you a weapon, and you go on your way.
Through fire and strife you will fight your way to the castle.
